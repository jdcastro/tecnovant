Foliar Nutrition Management System for Crops

## 1. Introduction

TecnoAgro is a software platform designed to manage data related to foliar nutrition in crops. It helps farmers optimize nutrient usage and increase productivity. Data is sourced from drone images processed externally and complemented with information entered manually.

The system receives this data through an API and a web form, analyzes it, and stores it to generate personalized recommendations based on local nutrient parameters. This approach enables precise decision making, improving resource efficiency and agricultural performance.
